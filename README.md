# Food-Recognition-using-SIFT-BoW-with-Traditional-Classifiers
This repository contains the implementation of a traditional machine learning approach using Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Bag of Words (BoW) representation with Support Vector Machines (SVM) for food recognition. The dataset used for this project is the iFood-2019-FGVC6 dataset, which comprises 251 food classes.
